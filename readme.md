PHPmSL
========

PHPmSL is an mSL interpreter written in PHP. See [supported constructs list](supported.md). As well as our [todo list](todo.md).

Usage:
--------

```php
$m = new mSL(); 
$m->loadFile('
    alias Hello {
        echo <strong>Hello World!</strong>
    }
'); 
$m->execScript("hello");
```

ChangeLog
--------

#### 9/18/09 ####
  * Added hash table support
  * Fixed issues with $regsubex
  * Added socket support
  * Added more support for events
  * Fixed bugs with variables not staying in scope

#### 9/03/09 ####


  * Made the parser into a class. I have changes a few of the method names for example, it's no longer parseMlines and parseMirc, parseMlines is now execScript. parseMirc is now execLine.
```php
    <?php
        $m = new mSL();
        $m->loadFile($_post['data']);
        $m->execScript("test"); // to execute the alias named test.
    ?>
```
  * alias are stored in a static member of the mSL class. so, to access it, just use mSL::aliases.

  * added all functions to it's own class. when checking if a function exists use this
```php
    <?php
        if (method_exists($this->function,$funcName)) {
        call_user_func_array(Array($this->function,$funcName),$args);
        }
    ?>
```
  * I have also added a $stackNumber (didn't know what else to call it) for execLine this will allow for accessing $prop and $isid which will need to be checked for internal commands as well. $isid for /remove and $remove. to check for this you need to do the following:
```php
    <?
        function myFunction() { 
            $localParams = $this->parent->getLocalParams();
            $p = $localParams['prop'];
            if ($p == "data") { 
                return "p = data";
            }
        }
    ?>
```
  and the same for $isid. Also worth noting that the 'parent' class mSL is in functions::$parent. so calling $this->parent from the functions class will get the mSL class instance.

  * added support for $v1 $v2 $ifmatch and the like. these are stored mSL::$_scope (not static). the scope variable is an assoc array. so far it uses $_scope['variables'] and $_scope['defined'] the $_scope['defined'] is where you will find $v1 $v2 ect... it will also be where event specific identifiers will be such as $nick $chan ect.
